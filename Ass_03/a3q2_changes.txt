# Changes:
1. Created count(stat) function, returns stat['count']
2. Created maximum(stat) function. Added functionality for it by initializing the
    'max' key within the stat in the create() function, and updating it in add()
3. Created minimum(stat) function. Added functionality for it by initializing the
    'min' key within the stat in the create() function, and updating it in add()
