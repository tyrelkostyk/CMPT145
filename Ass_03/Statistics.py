# CMPT 145: Abstract Data Types
# Defines the Statistics ADT
# Calculate mean and variance.

# Implementation
# Do the calculations without storing all the data!
# Uses a dictionary as a record to store three quantities:
#   'count':     the number of data values added
#   'avg':       the running average of the values added
#
# These values can be modified every time a new data value is 
# added, so that the mean and variance can be calculated quickly  
# as needed.  This approach means that we do not need to store  
# the data values themselves, which could save a lot of space.

#####################################################################
# NOTE: This version of the Statistics ADT is simplified for
# Assignment 3: all calculations relevant to variance are removed.
# This makes the testing a little easier!
